    "\n",
    "* Choice Justification:   \n",
    "  I chose this use case because access to immediate, reliable, and culturally-relevant health information is a significant challenge in Pakistan. While \"desi nuskay\" (home remedies) are a trusted first recourse for many, advice from family and the internet is often conflicting, unverified, and can be dangerous. This chatbot bridges the gap between traditional knowledge and evidence-based, safe practices, providing triage and guidance for common, minor ailments in a accessible, low-cost format.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Target Users:   \n",
    "Primarily adults and caregivers in Pakistan and the diaspora, especially those in semi-urban or rural areas with limited immediate access to doctors, or those seeking preliminary advice before deciding to visit a clinic.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Expected Benefits: \n",
    "Empowerment: Provides instant, actionable health guidance.\n",
    "Safety: Prevents harmful practices by offering vetted advice and clear warnings.\n",
    "Triage: Helps users distinguish between minor issues and situations requiring urgent professional care.\n",
    "Accessibility: Functions in Urdu and English on any device with a messaging interface, requiring no download.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limitations:\n",
    "Not a Medical Professional: It cannot diagnose, prescribe medicine, or treat serious conditions.\n",
    "Knowledge Cut-off: Its knowledge is based on its training data and may not have the latest medical research.\n",
    "Lack of Personalization: It does not know the user's full medical history, allergies, or current medications, so its advice is generic.\n",
    "Liability: It must be used with caution and always defer to a human doctor for any serious concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Justification**\n",
    "Why a Chatbot? This problem is ideal for a chatbot because it requires on-demand, conversational interaction. Users need to describe specific, often nuanced symptoms (e.g., \"meray gale mein khujli ho rahi hai\") and receive tailored advice. A static website or app lacks this interactive, Q&A nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Improvement over Alternatives:   \n",
    "Compared to a website (static information), it's dynamic and personalized. Compared to a full-featured app, it's lighter, faster to develop, and easier to access (e.g., via WhatsApp). Compared to human support, it's available 24/7, instantly, and for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Specific Tasks:  \n",
    " The chatbot will: 1) Triage symptoms to assess severity, 2) Provide safe, evidence-based home care instructions, 3) List what to avoid, 4) Suggest supportive dietary advice, and 5) Escalate by strongly recommending seeing a doctor when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. LLM Selection (Groq)**  \n",
    "* Selected Model: mixtral-8x7b-32768  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Justification:  \n",
    "Size & Capability: Mixtral is a Mixture-of-Experts model. While larger than 8B models, it is exceptionally capable at following complex, multi-part instructions (like our detailed system prompt) and reasoning about symptoms, which is crucial for safety. The 32k context window allows for longer, more detailed conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Language Support:   \n",
    "It has excellent performance in languages other than English, making it well-suited for understanding and generating responses in Urdu and Roman Urdu.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Speed:  \n",
    " Groq's LPU delivers incredibly fast inference speeds for this model. This is critical for a helpful user experience; waiting a long time for health advice feels frustrating and unreliable."

    "    **CRITICAL RULES - YOU MUST ALWAYS FOLLOW THESE:**\n",
    "    1.  **Triage First:** Your first job is to assess if this is a minor issue. Always ask 1-2 clarifying questions about symptoms. IF the user describes any of the following, you MUST immediately and clearly advise them to SEE A DOCTOR and STOP. Do not provide any remedies:\n",
    "        - High fever (>103°F or 39.4°C), especially in children.\n",
    "        - Severe, sharp, or persistent pain.\n",
    "        - Difficulty breathing.\n",
    "        - Symptoms in a child under 2 years old.\n",
    "        - Pregnancy.\n",
    "        - Symptoms lasting more than 7 days or getting worse.\n",
    "        - Any injury from a fall or accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  **Provide Safe Advice:** Only recommend well-known, evidence-based, and safe home remedies used in Pakistan (e.g., honey/lemon for cough, ginger tea for nausea, saline gargle for sore throat).\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  **Structure Your Response:** If the issue is minor, format your answer clearly under these headings:\n",
    "        - **Nuskha (Remedy):** Give 1-2 simple, step-by-step instructions.\n",
    "        - **In Se Parhaiz Karein (Avoid This):** List common but harmful or ineffective practices related to this ailment (e.g., no antibiotics without prescription, avoid excessive sugar/oil).\n",
    "        - **Diet (Kiya Khayen):** Suggest simple, easy-to-eat foods ( food acording to problem ).\n",
    "        - **Aakhir Mein (Disclaimer):** ALWAYS end with this: \"**Yeh salah aam takleefon ke liye hai. Agar aapki halat kharab ho ya aram na mehsoos ho, to fauran doctor se raabta karein.**\"\n",
